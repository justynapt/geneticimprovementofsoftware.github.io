## Keynote

<img align="right"  alt="drawing" width="120px" src="./profile_images/mark.jpg">

We are happy to announce that [Mark Harman](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman/) (Facebook, University College London) will give the keynote speech in GI 2020 ([link to paper](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WES-Agent-based-User-Interaction-Simulation-on-Real-Infrastructure.pdf)).

Mark Harman is an engineering manager at Facebook London, and also a part time professor of Software Engineering in the Department of Computer Science at University College London, where he directed the CREST centre for ten years (2006-2017) and was Head of Software Systems Engineering (2012-2017). His scientific work includes source code analysis, software testing, app store analysis and Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE), a field he co-founded and which has grown rapidly to include over 1,600 authors spread over more than 40 countries. In February 2017, he and the other two co-founders of the start-up Majicke moved to Facebook, London, where they are working on software test automation.

## Papers

**Human Factors in the Study of Automatic Software Repair** by Emily Winter, David Bowes Steve Counsell, Tracy Hall, Saemundur Haraldsson, Vesna Nowack, John Woodward

Automatic software repair represents a significant development in software engineering, promising considerable potential change to the working procedures and practices of software engineers, developers, and testers. Technical advances within this domain have been the focus of many recent publications. However, despite the simultaneous rising prominence of studies that consider the role of ‘human factors’ within software engineering, there has not been an equivalent growth of studies of human factors within the domain of automatic software repair. This short position paper presents the case for increased research in this area and suggests three key focuses and approaches for a future research agenda. These are: considerations that go beyond the current focus on the usability
of automatic software repair tools; longitudinal studies; and the use of a wide range of appropriate social research methods, not just surveys. All three of these position industry-based software engineers not just as providers of feedback on automatic software repair tools but as valuable participants in the shaping of these technologies, allowing for the development of tools that meet 
developer and industry needs, as well as allaying any concerns.

**Synthetic Benchmarks for Genetic Improvement** by Aymeric Blot, Justyna Petke

Genetic improvement (GI) uses automated search to find improved versions of existing software.
If over the years the potential of many GI approaches have been demonstrated, the intrinsic cost of evaluating real-world software makes comparing these approaches in large-scale meta-analyses very  expensive.
We propose and describe a method to construct synthetic GI benchmarks, to circumvent this bottleneck and enable much faster quality assessment of GI approaches.

**Stack-Based Genetic Improvement** by Aymeric Blot, Justyna Petke

Genetic improvement (GI) uses automated search to find improved versions of existing software.
If originally GI directly evolved populations of software, most GI work nowadays use a solution representation based on a list of mutations.
This representation however has some limitations, notably in how genetic material can be recombined.
We introduce a novel stack-based representation and discuss its possible benefits.

**Checkers: Multi-modal Darwinian API Optimisation** by Santanu Kumar Dash, Fan Wu, Michail Basios, Lingbo Li, Leslie Kanthan

Advent of microservices has increased the popularity of the API-first design principles. Developers have been focusing on concretising the API to a system before building the system. An API-first approach assumes that the API will be correctly used. Inevitably, most developers, even experienced ones, end-up writing sub-optimal software because of using APIs incorrectly. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach for exploring API equivalence and a framework to synthesise semantically equivalent programs. Unlike existing approaches to API transplantation, we propose an amorphous or formless approach to software translation in which a single API could potentially be replaced by a synthesised sequence of APIs which ensures type progress. Our search is guided by the non-functional goals for the software, a type-theoretic notion of progress and an automatic multi-modal embedding of the API from its documentation and code analysis.

**Towards Knowledge Guided Genetic Improvement** by Oliver Krauss

We outline a combination of Grammar Guided Genetic Programming with Tree Genetic Programming. Instead of utilizing a grammar directly, an operator graph based on that grammar is created, that is responsible for producing abstract syntax trees. Each operator contains knowledge about the grammar symbol it represents and returns only trees valid according to user-defined restrictions such as depth, complexity and approximated run-time performance. Initial Results show that the approach reduces invalid individuals in an evolutionary run, while supporting the extension towards further non-functional features.

Discussion Session

## <a name="CFP"></a> Call For Submissions [[pdf](https://github.com/geneticimprovementofsoftware/geneticimprovementofsoftware.github.io/raw/master/cfp.pdf)]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement. 
GI is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications include, but are not limited to, using GI to:

•	improve efficiency

•	decrease memory consumption

•	decrease energy consumption

•	transplant new functionality

•	specialise software

•	translate between programming languages

•	generate multiple versions of software

•	repair bugs

## Research & Position Papers
We invite submissions of two paper types:

•	Research papers (limit 8 pages)

•	Position papers (limit 2 pages)

We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work. The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.
All papers should be submitted via HotCRP:
<https://icse20-gi8.hotcrp.com/>
double-blind as pdfs (in the [ACM conference format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) as per the [ICSE 2020 information](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers#Call-for-Papers)) [[download LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip)].
> LaTeX users must use the provided `acmart.cls` and `ACM-Reference-Format.bst` *without modification*, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., `\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}`), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., `\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}`). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

All accepted papers must be presented at GI 2020 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available online.


## Studentships

There will be up to five travel scholarships available for students whose work is accepted at the workshop.
